# Voltaire ‚úçÔ∏è‚ö°  
*"Judge your notes by their questions, not just their answers."*

An **AI-powered Obsidian plugin** that transforms passive notes into an active knowledge network through semantic interrogation and dynamic organization.

---

## üîç Core Philosophy  
Voltaire embodies three Enlightenment principles for modern thinking:  
1. **Atomic Inquiry** - Each note becomes a discrete "thought experiment"  
2. **Socratic Organization** - AI-generated questions reveal hidden connections  
3. **Emergent Taxonomy** - Topics self-organize through semantic resonance  

---

## üöÄ Features  
### Cognitive Architecture  
- **Question-First Indexing** - Every note originates from an AI-generated question  
- **Semantic DNA** - Chunks maintain positional metadata for context preservation  
- **Adaptive Merging** - Related questions intelligently consolidate  

### Intelligent Processing Pipeline
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Note] --> B(Semantic Chunking)
    B --> C[Chunk Metadata]
    C --> D{AI Analysis}
    D --> E[Validate Questions]
    D --> F[Validate Topics]
    
    %% Question Path
    E --> G[VectorDB: Question Similarity]
    G --> H{Merge Threshold Reached?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Merge Questions]
    H -->|No| J[Create New Question]
    I --> K[Update Question Node]
    
    %% Topic Path
    F --> L[VectorDB: Topic Similarity]
    L --> M{Similar Topic Exists?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Use Existing Topic]
    M -->|No| O[Create New Topic]
    N --> P[Increment Usage Count]
    
    %% Unified Flow
    K & J & P & O --> Q[Update Knowledge Graph]
    Q --> R[Atomic File Operations]
    R --> S[Organize Hierarchy]
    S --> T[Final Annotated Note]
```

### Precision Controls  
- **Tunable Thresholds** for:  
  - Topic affinity  
  - Question similarity  
  - Category clustering  
- **Model Selection** (Supports GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)

## üß† Usage Patterns  

### Command Matrix  
| Action | Command | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Process Notes** | 'voltaire-run' | Initiates full analysis pipeline |
| **Reset State** | 'voltaire-reset' | Clears processing flags |
| **Force Rebuild** | 'voltaire-rebuild' | Bypasses cache for full reprocess |

### Workflow Example  
1. Add raw notes to `/<raw_notes>`  
2. Run processing:  
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[Raw Text] --> B(Chunking)
   B --> C(Question Extraction)
   C --> D(Topic Assignment)
   D --> E[Organized Output]
   ```
3. Discover connections in `/<knowledge_base>`

*Automatically generated knowledge structure*

## üèõ Philosophical Foundations  
Voltaire operationalizes:  
- **Luhmann's Zettelkasten** through AI-assisted linking  
- **Socratic Dialogue** via automated questioning  
- **Enlightenment Values** with computational rigor
